                            1.0.8

Advanced Software Production Line is happy to announce a new stable
release of the Valvula.

Valvula is a OpenSource high performance mail policy daemon for
Postfix, written in ANSI C, that provides out of the box support for
sender login mismatch, mail quotas, per user/domain blacklists/white-lists 
and much more.

Valvula is fully extensible through plugins and it is composed by a
base library (libValvula) that integrates into a ready to use server
(valvulad) that is able to run different ports with different modules
so you can connect same valvula process at different points inside
Postfix policy restriction sections.

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

 - Added new module (mod-object-resolver) to help valvulad engine to
   detect local addresses and domains for especific configurations not
   using MySQL like Plesk.

 - Added new policy (deny-unknown-local-mail-from='yes') to mod-bwl
   that allows to deny transactions using valid local domains to
   create forged mail-from addresses. This policy applies by default
   and can be controlled using regular mod-bwl rules.

 - Added new API interface that allows registering generic functions
   that are called to resolve if a domain or local address is a valid
   local destination.

 - Added generic SQLite interface to allow writing modules using this
   backend (used by mod-object-resolver).

 - Several corrections, improvements, doc updates...


Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Making mod-object-resolver to also reconfigure
  /var/spool/postfix/plesk/ directory to ensure (chmod o-rwx && chmod
  o+x) so applications can read virtual.db and other root 644 files.

* [fix] Updated regression test (test_05) to check new API added:

   - valvulad_run_remove_object_resolver  

  ..and to test new function introduced into mod-bwl to reject unknown
  accounts targetting known local accounts (deny_unknown_local_mail_from).


* [fix] Updated valvula to include a new type of protection to reject
  unknown accounts targetting to known local accounts ::
  deny_unknown_local_mail_from

* [fix] Reorganized valvulad_run_add_object_resolver function to use
  code provided by new function (to remove handler) and make it
  cleaner. API added:

  - valvulad_run_remove_object_resolver

* [fix] Updated code to preread and check uid and gid to be used so
  modules can use this information to prepare itself...then, once
  everything is loaded, valvula changes running uid and gid.

* [fix] Fixed mod-object-resolver to avoid changing permissions when
  running uid and gid is 0

* [fix] Updated valvula engine to keep track about running uid and gid.
* [fix] Updated log reporting to state if a delivery is local or non-local.

* [fix] Updated mod-object-resolver to configure permissions on
  startup to ensure passwd.db from plesk is correctly accessed by
  valvula.

* [fix] Fixed gid reporting..

* [fix] Updated valvulad_db_sqlite run query to report uid=, euid= and
  errno in case of sqlite error

* [fix] More updates to fix sqlite3_errstr detection

* [fix] Indented code inside __valvulad_sqlite3_get_error_code and
  added ENABLE_SQLITE_SUPPORT macro to avoid including this code.

* [fix] Updated configure process to detect if sqlite_errstr is available.

* [fix] Added initial code to substitute sqlite3_errstr with
   __valvulad_sqlite3_get_error_code because the former is not always
   available (ubuntu precise, squeeze and lenny has no support for
   such function).

* [fix] Improved error message when valvulad is not able to open
  sqlite3 database..

* [fix] Updated valvula.spec to include reference to sqlite package
  for centos.

* [fix] More updates to control files (debian/ubuntu).

* [fix] Updated server/Makefile.am to include references to
  sqlite3_libs for libvalvulad (seems to be causing problems in ubuntu
  precise).

  Centos

* [fix] Adding install file for valvulad-mod-object-resolver
  (debian/ubuntu).

* [fix] Adding initial support for valvulad-mod-object-resolver.

* [fix] added initial documentation explaining how to use valvulad's
  mod-object-resolver.

* [fix] Added additional documentation to explain module activation
  with and without port association.

* [fix] Updated valvulad-mgr.py to support two new functions to enable
  and disable modules without port association.

* [fix] Added initial complete implementation for mod-object-resolver
  (a module that uses new API to add object resolutions that enables
  valvulad to be able to detect domains and accounts that do not use
  mysql interface).

* [fix] Added new regression test (test_02h) to check external object
  resolvers (functions that allows providing resolution support to
  valvulad engine about accounts and domains that are local).

* [fix] Added new functions to support registering an external handler
  that works as an object resolver (account or domain that are
  detected as local).  API added:

  - ValvuladObjectResolver (handler)
  - valvulad_run_add_object_resolver
  - ValvuladObjectRequest (enum)
    |    VALVULAD_OBJECT_ACCOUNT
    |    VALVULAD_OBJECT_DOMAIN
    |    VALVULAD_OBJECT_ALIAS

  

* [fix] Added initial working initialization code to have support for
  object resolvers at valvulad (external handlers that tells if an
  object is a local domain or a local account).

* [fix] Added complete regression test (test_02g) to check new Sqlite
  API added..

* [fix] Exported hidden function for valvulad main server..

* [fix] Updated valvulad server to also load modules when requested to

* [fix] Added new regression test to check bug reported. Everything ok
  so far..

* [fix] Added some debug to mod-mquota module to better report what's
  doing.

* [fix] Updated valvulad mysql configuration detection to better
