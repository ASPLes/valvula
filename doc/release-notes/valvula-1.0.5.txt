                      She's fine for me
                           1.0.5

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the Valvula.

Valvula is a OpenSource high performance mail policy daemon for
Postfix, written in ANSI C, that provides out of the box support for
sender login mismatch, mail quotas, per user and per domain blacklists
and white-lists and much more.

Valvula is fully extensible through plugins and it is composed by a
base library (libValvula) that integrates into a ready to use server
(valvulad) that is able to run different ports with different modules
so you can connect same valvula process at different points inside
Postfix policy restriction sections.
